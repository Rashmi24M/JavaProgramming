# Java Daily Practice Repository

A collection of my daily Java practice programs focused on improving problem-solving skills, language understanding, and code quality.  
This repository serves as my personal learning log and a structured reference for interview preparation.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen core Java fundamentals
- Practice consistently
- Build habit of writing clean, readable code
- Prepare for coding interviews & assessments

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Install JDK (Java Development Kit)
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
Run:

bash
Copy code
java ProgramName
🔄 Daily Update Convention
When adding new programs, use consistent commit messages:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Day 08: Added Binary Search program"
git push
Helps track progress day-by-day.

🧠 Topics Being Covered (Progressive Learning)
✅ Basics & conditional statements

✅ Loops & patterns

✅ Arrays & Strings

🔄 Methods & Recursion

🔄 OOP Concepts

⏳ Collections & Exception handling

⏳ Multithreading

🌱 Learning Approach
Understand → Practice → Re-write → Optimize

Focus on clean variable names, modular code, and logical clarity

No copy-paste — every solution is typed & reasoned

🤝 Contributions
This is primarily a personal practice space. Suggestions for better coding style or optimizations are welcome.

### ✅ What You Can Do Next:
If you want, I can also:
- Generate **daily practice log table**
- Create **badges** (Java version / Code style / Last updated)
- Suggest **repo name ideas** (professional-looking)

Just tell me:
**How many programs you have uploaded so far?** 🙂
